# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, for use across OSX, and Linux instances in vagrant and in cloud.

# To download

```
cd
git clone https://github.com/cerico/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
```

To install packages and then link dotfiles

```
./install.sh
./bootstrap.sh
```

To just link, without installing

```
./bootstrap.sh
```

(note, this will install oh-my-zsh if it isn't present, but it won't clobber the dotfiles .zshrc)
